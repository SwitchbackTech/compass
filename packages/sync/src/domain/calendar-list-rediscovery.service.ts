//
// syncCalendarList decides full-vs-incremental purely from whether the stored
// cursor is null (`fullList = resource.syncCursor === null`), so clearing the
// cursor here is what forces the eventual pass to go full — it does not matter
// whether that pass is this sweep's own enqueue or one that coalesced onto an
// already-pending job; either reads the cleared cursor and full-lists. The
// cursor clear runs inside enqueueForResources's per-resource try/catch, so
// one doomed resource never abandons the rest of the batch.
