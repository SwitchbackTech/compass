// Two passes drive the reader. A WINDOWED pass over the rolling horizon runs
// first so the user's useful range appears quickly; it cannot yield a cursor
// (providers forbid combining a window with one), so a FULL unwindowed pass
// follows, checkpointing the page token in the sync resource after each page
// commits — a crash resumes from the checkpoint instead of restarting. The
// incremental cursor is committed only after the full pass and every projection
// it implies have completed, so the cursor never advances past uncommitted
// data. Every write is an idempotent provider-identity upsert and every
// projection replaces per (event, generation), so re-running any prefix
// converges.
//
// A deleted occurrence of an otherwise-active series comes back from a full
// list (showDeleted) as a cancellation carrying its series link; it is written
// as a cancelled exception so the master's expansion excludes that instant,
// never resurrecting the deleted occurrence.
//
// Ordering hazards handled:
// - A series MEMBER (a modified instance or a cancelled occurrence) can arrive
//   before its master (providers return events in arbitrary order). Unresolved
//   members are buffered and retried after each page and once more at the end
//   of each pass; a member whose master never appears is counted skipped. Named
//   wart: a buffered cross-page member is lost if the process crashes after its
//   own page was checkpointed but before its master arrived — bounded to one
//   exception, and repair or an incremental pull re-delivers it.
// - A master's projection must exclude the instants its exceptions own, and an
//   exception can land pages after its master. Masters therefore reproject
//   from a fresh exception read every time one of their exceptions links, and
//   projections for a page run BEFORE that page's checkpoint so a resumed run
//   never skips them.
