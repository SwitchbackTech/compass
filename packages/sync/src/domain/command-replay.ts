// Whether a terminal command's replay should be treated as a genuine no-op
// (the world already matches what it once confirmed) or as stale (this
// submission is really a fresh intent that happens to share an identity/
// content key with an earlier terminal command).
//
// The delete idempotency key is deliberately identity-only (eventId/scope/
// recurrenceId — see toDeleteSubmitRequest in event-command.translation.ts),
// so a delete, undo (recreate under the SAME event id — see the "A25" doc
// comment in useUndoRedo.ts), and delete-again collide on the exact same key.
// Without this check, submitCloudCommand's short-circuit at the top of the
// function returns the OLD confirmed command forever: 204 to the caller, no
// provider call, no local change, and no TTL on `commands` to ever clear it.
// A delete resubmit needs no explicit intent flag to get this treatment - a
// world-state check (does the event still look deleted?) is enough on its
// own, since a delete's only failure mode from checking too eagerly is
// re-deleting an already-deleted event, which is harmless.
//
// create and update are different: the create idempotency key
// (`create:${eventId}`) is stable for that event id's whole lifetime, and the
// update key hashes its full content (see toReplaceSubmitRequests), so ANY
// later resubmission of the same payload collides with the original - not
// only an undo/redo replay. A world-state guess gets this wrong in a way
// that's NOT harmless: packages/web/src/common/utils/sync/
// local-event-sync.util.ts's offline promotion retries a create under the
// record's own stable id whenever the client never observed the first
// attempt's success; if the user deletes that event before the retry fires,
// "existing === null ⇒ stale" would silently resurrect an event the user
// deliberately removed. Nothing in the command history can tell "the delete
// this replay's undo is reversing" apart from "an unrelated delete that
// happened since" - so create/update are guarded only when the client
// explicitly marks the submission `restore: true` (set by useUndoRedo's
// replays, never by offline promotion) rather than guessing from world state.
