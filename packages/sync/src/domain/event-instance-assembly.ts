// Assemble the full-fidelity event rows the browser read returns, from a page of
// materialized occurrence rows joined to their owning event records. Pure: all
// I/O (occurrence range read, batch event hydration) happens in the caller, so
// every recurring-event subtlety is unit-testable without a database.
//
// `eventsById` must contain every event referenced by an occurrence's `eventId`
// AND, for any exception among those, the master named by its `seriesId` — the
// caller does both fetch hops. Rows whose owning event is missing are skipped
// defensively rather than throwing (an occurrence transiently orphaned from its
// event should not fail the whole page).
//
// Row model (mirrors what the legacy store materializes, so the browser contract
// is unchanged):
//   - single event            -> one `single` row
//   - plain series instance    -> one `occurrence` row (recurrenceId = its start)
//   - overridden instance      -> one `occurrence` row (recurrenceId = the
//                                 exception's ORIGINAL start, not its moved start)
//   - each referenced series    -> one `series` master row, appended out-of-band
//                                 (the app keeps it for edit-all-future but
//                                 suppresses it from rendering)
// Cancelled instances are omitted entirely: a deleted occurrence simply must not
// appear, exactly as it wouldn't in the legacy store.
