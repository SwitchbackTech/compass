// stop delivering WITHOUT expiring (Google drops one whose callbacks keep
// failing), and since every liveness path we have selects on
// subscriptionExpiresAt, re-watching on a cadence is what bounds how long such
// a channel can stay silently dead. Raising the provider TTL without raising

// order would open a window where neither the old nor the new channel delivers.
//
// Idempotent enough to run twice: a resource whose channel still has plenty of
// life reports "current" and touches nothing, so a redundant maintain job (a
// racing sweep, a re-run after a crash) does not churn the channel.
//
// A transient watch failure throws so the worker retries with backoff. Terminal
// provider verdicts are folded into an outcome: an unwatchable or durably
// refused resource ("unsupported") falls back to polling, and a revoked
// credential ("authRevoked") waits for a reconnect. Both settle the job rather
// than burn the retry ladder (2026-08-07: one watchFailed job logged 78
// PostHog exceptions across 20 attempts before failing).
