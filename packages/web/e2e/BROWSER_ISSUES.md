# Browser Installation Issues

## Current Issue

The Playwright browser download is failing with a size mismatch error. This appears to be an issue with the download process in the current environment.

## Workarounds

### Option 1: Use System Browser (if available)

Configure Playwright to use a system-installed browser by updating `playwright.config.ts`:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  // ... other config
  use: {
    // Try using system browser
    channel: "chrome", // or 'chromium'
    // ... other options
  },
});
```

### Option 2: Manual Browser Installation

If you have access to a different environment:

1. Run `npx playwright install chromium` on a machine with better network access
2. Copy the browser installation to this environment

### Option 3: Alternative Test Strategy

For now, tests can be written and validated against the code structure without running the full browser tests.

## Running Tests Without Browsers

The test files are ready and can be executed once the browser installation is resolved:

```bash
yarn test:e2e
```

## Next Steps

1. Resolve the browser download issue
2. Run the OAuth test with manual authentication
3. Save authentication state for automated tests
