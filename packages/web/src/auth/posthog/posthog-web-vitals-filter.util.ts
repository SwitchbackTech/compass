 * 2026-08-26. A zero is not a fast page, it is the absence of a measurement,
 * and left in place it drags every average toward zero exactly when the sample
 * count is too small to absorb it.
 *
 * A single `$web_vitals` event carries whichever metrics happened to be in
 * posthog's flush buffer, so this strips only the bogus metric's own properties
