 * isVisible from that store on every read (calendar.query.ts), so this hook
 * only writes storage once - no cache patch to keep in sync. Event queries
 * keep their data; the week/day view models filter by isVisible so hide and
 * show both update the grid without a round trip. No server write - sync
 * list always reports isVisible:true, and the event read already returns
 * every calendar (client filter is the source of truth).
