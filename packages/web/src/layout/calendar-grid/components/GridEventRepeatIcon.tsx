 * The recurrence indicator shared by the timed and all-day grid cards: a small

 * event's priority color so it complements the card instead of a loud fixed
 * white. Keeping it in one place stops the two cards from drifting apart.
 * Decorative — the recurring state is announced via each card's aria-label.
