 * fetch. `queryOptionsFn` must be the same options builder (and `previous`/
 * `next` the same date-formatting) the corresponding read hook uses for the
 * current range, so the prefetched entries land under the exact keys a
 * subsequent read would look up — a mismatched format prefetches a phantom
 * entry the real read never finds.
 *
 * `prefetchQuery` is a no-op for entries that are already cached and fresh
 * (within `staleTime`), so re-running this on every render is safe.
