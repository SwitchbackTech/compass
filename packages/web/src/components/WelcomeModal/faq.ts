    question: "What does 'the keyboard calendar' actually mean?",
    answer:
      "You can target any element on screen without endless Tabbing, chain shortcuts into sequences, and pull up a command palette for anything you can't remember. Compass surfaces the right shortcut at the right moment instead of dumping the full list on you. It feels a bit like playing Tetris.",
