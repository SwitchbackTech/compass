 * Day view columns are calendars on the same date. Week-style row assignment
 * treats every same-day event as overlapping, so N calendars' all-day events
 * stack into N vertical rows. Assign rows per calendar column instead so
 * events in different columns can share a row and the all-day strip stays short.
 *
 * Within a column every displayed all-day event covers the same day, so they
 * always overlap — stacking in input order is enough (no day-span packing).
 * Rows are keyed by encounter order (not `_id`) so untitled drafts without an
 * id still keep their stacked row.
