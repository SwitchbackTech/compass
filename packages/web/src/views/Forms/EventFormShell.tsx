 * Outer `<form>` for the event form. Transparent full-height flex column so
 * the sidebar's own background shows through — the form is part of the
 * sidebar, not a card floating on it. Children own scrolling and padding
 * (EventForm renders a scrollable body plus a pinned footer). The
 * (resizable) sidebar width is the single source of the form's size.
 * Content-agnostic: callers pass their fields as children and any
 * form-specific props (`name`, mouse handlers, an extra `className`).
