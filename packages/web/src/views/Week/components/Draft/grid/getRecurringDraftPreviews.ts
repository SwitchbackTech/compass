/**
 * Expand a recurring timed draft into read-only preview occurrences that fall
 * within the visible week, so the user sees the full effect of the recurrence
 * before saving. The interactive draft still renders its own occurrence; these
 * are the *other* days.
 *
 * Occurrences run forward from the draft's start (the series' first instance)
 * through the end of the view — the same instances the saved event would have.
 * We deliberately don't backfill days before the draft's start, because the
 * saved series wouldn't exist there either; the preview reflects that reality.
 *
 * Derived from the draft on every render (no stored state), so discarding the
 * draft clears the previews for free and dragging/editing it updates them.
 * Returns [] for non-recurring drafts and for all-day drafts (previewed
 * separately by the all-day row).
