    removes the last number so that it doesn't overlap with neighboring events
    example:
      - an event on July 4 is represented as yyyy-07-04 - yyyy-07-05
        - its original day numbers are: [85, 86]
      - this will cause it to erroneously overlap with an event on July 5
        - because July 5 day numbers will be [86, 87]
        - 86 is shared between both days
      - removing the second number fixes this, because:
        - July 4 is represented as [85]
        - July 5 is [86]
        - There is no overlap, so they can fit on the same row
