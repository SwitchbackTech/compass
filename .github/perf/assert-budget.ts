/**
 * Performance budget gate, invoked by .github/workflows/perf-budget.yml.
 *
 * Runs Lighthouse against the compressed local server a few times per profile
 * and asserts the median against the budgets below. Medians are used because
 * single Lighthouse runs vary run-to-run, especially on CI runners.
 *
 * Lighthouse is pinned because @lhci/cli's bundled Lighthouse 12 reports
 * NO_LCP against current Chrome; 13.x traces LCP correctly.
 *
 * Two profiles, because desktop alone was hiding the problem that matters.
 * Desktop is the blocking gate. Mobile (Lighthouse's default preset: mobile
 * emulation over throttled 4G) is warn-only and exists because production's
 * slowest real users are mobile and far from the origin - the cohort desktop
 * numbers say nothing about. Both run against localhost, so neither sees real
 * RTT; treat mobile as a throttling proxy, not a field measurement.
 *
 * CALIBRATE THESE FROM A CI RUN, NEVER FROM A LAPTOP. The same build measures
 * ~150 KB smaller locally than on an ubuntu-latest runner, so local numbers
 * will set a budget that fails the moment it lands. Read the actuals off a
 * recent green run of this workflow on main.
 *
 * Baseline (2026-09-02, ubuntu-latest, over gzip), measured after the booking
 * stack left the boot path:
 *   desktop  LCP ~2.01s, FCP ~1.41s, script transfer 976,450 bytes
 *   mobile   LCP ~8.27s, FCP ~6.28s
 * The immediately preceding main was ~984,700 bytes, so that change is worth
 * ~8 KB of real transfer.
 *
 * Recalibrated 2026-09-04: main measured 990,400 bytes, 400 over the old
 * 990 KB budget, after a day of booking and billing merges. The 1,000 KB
 * script budget left ~10 KB of headroom.
 *
 * Recalibrated 2026-09-07: main measured 1,034,338 bytes after react-toastify
 * 9 → 11 (boot-path CompassProvider) and the multi-provider UI. The 1,060 KB
 * script budget leaves ~25 KB of headroom, still far under the ~170 KB gz
 * editor stack (TipTap/react-datepicker/react-select), so a static re-import
 * of the event form still fails the gate. Script transfer is
 * near-deterministic (runs vary by tens of bytes), so it can sit this tight;
 * the paint metrics vary by runner and get much wider headroom.
