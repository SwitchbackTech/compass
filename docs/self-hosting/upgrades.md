# Upgrades

How to upgrade a self-hosted Compass install: normal image updates, when a
database migration is involved, and the one-time sub-calendar v1 cutover.

**Back up first, every time.** See [Back up & restore](./backup-and-restore.md)
— `./compass update` and `./compass rebuild` don't snapshot your data or your
old app version, so a bad upgrade has no automatic rollback otherwise.

## Normal upgrades (published images)

Most upgrades are a pull-and-restart of the published DockerHub images:

```bash
cd ~/compass
./compass update
```

This runs `docker compose pull` then `docker compose up -d` and waits for
the backend health check. It does not touch your data volumes, and it does
not run database migrations (see below) — it only replaces the running
containers with newer images at whatever version `compass.yaml` points at.

## Upgrades from your own source checkout

If you run [custom code](./customizing.md) — your own fork, or values baked
into the web bundle at build time — update your git checkout and rebuild
locally instead of pulling published images:

```bash
git pull
cd ~/compass
./compass rebuild
```

`./compass rebuild` builds images locally with Docker instead of pulling
them. It requires the build blocks in `compose.yaml` to be uncommented and
the full repo checkout present alongside it — see the [Custom code
guide](./customizing.md). It restarts and health-checks the same way
`update` does.

## When you need to run a migration manually

Migrations **never run automatically** on deploy — neither `./compass
update`, `./compass rebuild`, nor the backend container's own startup (its
entrypoint is the app server, nothing else) invokes the migration runner. If
a release adds one, you run it yourself; check the release notes for
whether it belongs before or after the image update.

```bash
bun run cli migrate pending   # check what's pending
bun run cli migrate up        # run everything pending
```

Both live in `packages/scripts`. The runner reads its Mongo connection from
your config file — set `COMPASS_CONFIG_FILE=~/compass/compass.yaml` outside
the dev repo — and needs to run from a machine or container that can reach
the compose network, since Docker installs don't publish the Mongo port to
the host.

Back up before running any migration; see [Back up &
restore](./backup-and-restore.md). Migrations here are written to be
additive and non-destructive (`packages/scripts/src/migrations/`), but the
backup is still the only rollback if one behaves unexpectedly.

One current migration is cleanup rather than additive: `priority-data-cleanup`
(`2026.07.14T10.00.00`) removes the now-dead `priority` field left over from
the removed priority-tagging feature and drops its orphaned collection. It's
routine — run it like any other pending migration.

## Upgrading from a pre-cutover install (before v1.0.236)

The sub-calendar v1 release (2026-07) moved events out of the legacy `event`
collection into a calendar-owned schema behind a one-time collection rename.
The migration code for that cutover shipped in releases up to **v1.0.310**
and was removed afterwards, so releases newer than v1.0.310 cannot migrate a
pre-cutover database.

If your install has never performed the cutover, upgrade in two steps:

1. Upgrade to
   [v1.0.310](https://github.com/SwitchbackTech/compass-calendar/tree/v1.0.310)
   and complete the cutover following that version's
   [event migration runbook](https://github.com/SwitchbackTech/compass-calendar/blob/v1.0.310/docs/self-hosting/event-migration-runbook.md).
2. Then upgrade to the latest release as a normal upgrade and run any
   remaining pending migrations.

Installs that already cut over (or were first installed after v1.0.236)
upgrade normally and can ignore this section.
